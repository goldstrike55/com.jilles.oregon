Homey app to view Oregon Scientific sensor info in Athom Homey

It can take a time before the app reads a interpretable signal from the sensor , wait an hour before trying to pair a device.

After battery change with reset the rolling code( last 2 hex digits from the name ) can be changed and the device should be repaired.

The RF 2.1 and 3.0 protocol from  Oregon Scientific can be read.



I have now 6 sensor devices added the BTHR968 device id 5d60 (first for hex digits from name) and the
THGR122NX, THGN132ES, THGR228N device id 1d20 rainmeter PCR800 deviceid 2914 and uv meter UVR128 deviceid ec70

install the THGN132ES or THGR228N as THGR122NX

19-09-2016 added THN132N sensor to be tested yet by third party , i dont have that sensor
           install THWR800 or THR238NF as THN132N sensor.
